# TODO: add unit-tests for the remaining modules
"""
Some tests to add:

    . Evaluate if the commands are:
        - creating the correct amount of files
        - creating the correct amount of columns inside the resulting files. Ex: -cr creates an additional column
        - storing the output files in the correct location. Ex:
            * evaluating a single file should get its result inside "individual_runs/"
            * TSAFileBlocks creates the blocks folder inside "file_blocks/"

    . Evaluate if the the output/temporary/debug directories are being created when necessary
